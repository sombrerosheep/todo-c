# todo

its a very small, minimal todo app meant for "practice".

The idea was to spark some participation in a team meeting for jr developers by having "homework"; people can write a small program (todo in this case) and then demo it. Language and frameworks are 100% up to the developer. Anyone who participates has the option to present and show off their work!

Most of the team works in javascript all day so I felt doing this in C might prove to be inspiring since the two languages do things in very different ways.
